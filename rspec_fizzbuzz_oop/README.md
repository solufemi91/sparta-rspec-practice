# sparta-rspec-fizzbuzz-oop


### The brief

The objective was to build a fizzbuzz program and to write a automated tests which checked that the program did what it was suppose to do. For example, respond 'true' if a number was divisble by 3 and check that the correct word was printed out for the correct multiple.

### Instructions to run the test

In order to run the test, run the command rspec from the rspec_fizzbuzz_oop location.

Here is a link to the rspec cheatsheet: https://gist.github.com/eliotsykes/5b71277b0813fbc0df56
